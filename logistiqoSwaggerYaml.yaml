         An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of protocols,
          routines, and tools that enable different software applications to
          communicate and exchange data with each other. It defines how software
          components should interact and helps to simplify software development by
          abstracting the underlying implementation. APIs are essential for building
          complex and interconnected software systems.

  /logistiqo/rest/api/v-1/manifest/add:
    post:

          This API provides a comprehensive set of functionalities to export unplanned, planned, and optimized tours or bundles of shipments, regardless of whether they are transported by your own vehicles or contractors.

          While importing shipments may be your primary objective, it is crucial to bundle them within a manifest. To prevent the creation of manifests, simply set the 'createManifest' field to false. It is also important to use a unique reference for each manifest to ensure data integrity within the system.
          
          Moreover, this API empowers you to effortlessly create Master and House Air Waybills (MAWB and HAWB). You can leverage the manifest fields for the MAWB and the shipment fields for the HAWB. By designating the manifest as a MAWB, you establish a seamless link between the shipment and the MAWB. Similarly, including a HAWB within the shipment establishes a clear connection between the shipment and the HAWB. In the event that either the MAWB or the HAWB does not exist, this API will automatically generate both to maintain consistency.
          
          With these powerful capabilities, this API simplifies and enhances the management of shipments, manifests, and Air Waybills, ensuring efficient and accurate logistics operations.
